# Design-of-a-Transimpedance-Amplifier-for-Photodiodes
This project designs and tests a low-noise Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) for photodiodes BPW 21 and SFH 229, evaluating DC, AC, and noise performance. Optimized for high gain and stable bandwidth, itâ€™s suited for precision optical sensing and light measurement applications.
