# Design of a Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) for Photodiodes

## Overview
This project presents the **design, simulation, and PCB layout** of a high-sensitivity Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) optimized for use with photodiodes.  
Two photodiode models were evaluated: **BPW 21** and **SFH 229**, with a focus on DC performance, frequency response, and noise characteristics.

## Objective
The primary goal was to design a low-noise, high-gain transimpedance amplifier capable of accurately converting photodiode current into a measurable voltage signal, suitable for optical sensing applications.

## Photodiodes Used
- **BPW 21** – High responsivity photodiode
- **SFH 229** – Silicon photodiode with low capacitance

## Circuit Design
- **Topology:** Op-amp based TIA
- **Feedback Resistors:** Tested at **5 MΩ** and **50 MΩ**
- **Simulation Tools:** [Specify tool used, e.g., LTspice, PSpice, Multisim]
- **PCB Layout:** Designed for low parasitics and minimal noise pickup

## Simulation & Analysis Results

### DC Sweep
- BPW 21 and SFH 229 tested with **R1 = 5 MΩ**
- Output voltage shows expected linear relationship with photodiode current

### AC Sweep (Frequency Response)
- Frequency response measured for both photodiodes
- Performance optimized for target bandwidth

### Noise Analysis
- **Integrated Noise:**
  - BPW 21: 36.6 µV
  - SFH 229: 4.1 µV
- **Peak-to-Peak Noise (50 MΩ feedback):**
  - BPW 21: 34.54 mV (Effective Noise: 5.76 mV)
  - SFH 229: 7.36 mV (Effective Noise: 1.23 mV)

### Offset Measurements
- BPW 21: −1.228 mV
- SFH 229: −524 µV
